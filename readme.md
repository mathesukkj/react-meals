# React - Meals

This is a meals listing app built with React and styled-components. This project was completed as part of the [React - The Complete Guide course](www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

## Project Objective

This project is a comprehensive meal-listing app designed to showcase my proficiency in certain advanced React concepts. Its main objective is to allow users to browse a list of 4 different meals, select them to add to their cart, and specify their quantity. To achieve this, I used some of React's advanced features, such as state management with reducers, useEffect, and the Context API. 




## Tech Stack

-   React
-   Styled Components


## Features

Learned features:

- `Context-API`: Used to share the cart-context to all components.
- `useReducer`: Used to add meals to the cart.
- `Portals`: Used to render the cart modal outside of its parent component.
